Centre for Educational Technology is the research centre of the School of Digital Technology, [Tallinn University (TLU)](http://www.tlu.ee). Centre was established more than 20 years ago and is now one of the leading competency-centres in technology-enhanced learning in Estonia.

The Centre focuses on theoretical, methodological and practical questions related to educational uses of technologies for teaching and learning in formal and informal educational settings. Our Centre investigates the development, adoption and use of technologies in several areas of society with the data-driven focus. Special emphasis is put on technologies in education (learning environments and technologies, organisational level digital transformation, digital competencies, game-based learning, STEM education and location-based technologies) and industry (ICT sector, healthcare, construction etc). 

The centre encourages highly links between research and teaching. Our teaching is research-led and research is informed by our teaching. We involve our MA and PhD students to our projects and research activities. Our teaching programs on MA level are international level programs: Digital Learning Games and Open Society Technologies and local program Educational Technology. Also is center actively collaborating with the Estonian schools to pilot research-based solutions and methodologies.
