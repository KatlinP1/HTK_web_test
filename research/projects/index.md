### EduMap - Adult Education as a Means to Active Participatory Citizenship 

The aim of the project Adult Education as a Means to Active Participatory Citizenship (EduMAP) is to understand and develop the real and potential impact of adult education on learning for active participatory citizenship in Europe. The main research question is: What policies and practices are needed in the field of adult education to include young adults at risk of social exclusion in active participatory citizenship in Europe? EduMAP will compile an inventory of the adult education policies and practices in EU Member States, with a particular focus on their relevance with regard to young adults at risk of social exclusion. Successful educational practices within and outside the EU will be mapped and investigated, in order to help educational agencies to design initiatives catering for the varied needs of vulnerable minority groups. To understand how the providers and users of educational initiatives are situated in the flows of information and communication, we will study and map communicative ecologies in the field of adult education and develop innovative forums for dialogue between educational agencies and young people. The research findings will be used to generate an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) to give policy-makers and other stakeholders easy access to the information required to address the needs of vulnerable minority groups. The fundamental aim is to help policy-makers, educational authorities and educators to ensure that young generations as a whole will attain the competences needed to actively participate in society and the labour market.

### SmartZoos - Cross-border services for creative adventure learning in the zoos of the Central Baltic Region

https://project.smartzoos.eu/

Zoos are important institutions of preserving the natural heritage of the CB region - protecting and preserving endangered species and at the same time increasing the environmental awareness. At the moment, the use of mobile technologies for learning by visitors of the zoos is very traditional, mainly providing static information. There is an active cooperation network between the zoos of the CB region, but at the moment it is limited mainly on exchanging animals and conducting joint research.  Therefore the main objective of the current project is to integrate the zoos of the CB region into joint tourist attraction through developing and implementing a cross-border service package for creative adventure learning with mobile devices. It consists of a set of online game-based learning tools and related apps for mobile devices. The SmartZoo mobile learning service provides a reason for visitors to return to zoo several times a year and visit several zoos in one year. Thus, the SmartZoo enhances both the environmental awareness and economical growth of the CB region.
