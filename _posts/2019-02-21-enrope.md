Tallinn University is one of the partners in the project ENROPE - European Network for Junior Researchers in the Field of Plurilingualism and Education, coordinated by the Humboldt University of Berlin. The Centre for Educational Technology has the leading role in developing an Online Platform for researcher collaboration.

The project aims to provide high-quality qualification and networking structures for professional development for junior researchers in the field of language education and plurilingualism. An Intensive Study Programme (ISP) will be provided for junior researchers, a Qualification Handbook will be produced, an Online Platform for collaboration and embedded E-Portfolio will be developed.

In addition to Tallinn University and the coordinating partner Humboldt University of Berlin, the project will be realised by Fryske Akademy, Goethe University Frankfurt, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, University of Exeter, Ramon Llull University, University of Siegen and Sorbonne Nouvelle University- Paris 3.

The project’s kick-off meeting took place in Frankfurt at Goethe University Frankfurt, where Tallinn University presented ENROPE’s newly launched website: https://enrope.eu/. During the meeting, the partners discussed plans and agreements for successful project management, strategies for quality assurance and dissemination, preparation of the first ISP programme and Intellectual Outputs production strategies and timelines. 
The second project meeting will take place in Exeter at the University of Exeter in March.
