Industry and academia representers are meeting on September 14-15 at the Industry Track of the European Conference on Technology Enhanced learning to exchange ideas regarding the social aspects of Industry 4.0. The topics will include the workplace of the future, motivating workers, workplace learning, knowledge sharing and new tools, and how competencies ignite innovation.

The objective of the track is to bring together the representatives of industries, educational organizations and training providers, to map future actions and cooperation points to alleviate the risks and dangers of the new industrial era.

According to different sources, by 2020 there will be a lack of 825 000 - 1.5 mil workers in ICT sector alone, while automation endangers many other jobs and their stability. To avoid workforce crisis, the stakeholders have to join forces and think through the organization of retraining and upskilling of the workforce.

The presenters of the Industry Track represent prominent companies from Estonia and around the world, including Heiti Mering (Tieto), Olari Koppel (Raintree Eesti) ja Mait Müntel (Lingvist). Dr. Viktoria Pammer-Schindler (Know-Center) will give an overview of the challenges and potential solutions of workplace learning and Dr. Fridolin Wild (WEKIT) will introduce intelligent learning and training tools. Triin Ploompuu from the Federation of Estonian Engineering Industry discusses what happens to humans on the brink of Industry 4.0. Stenver Jerkku from eAgronomi shares their experience of a 5-hour workday and Magnus Meldre (BlueMonday) introduces the new paradigm to Human Resources – HR 4.0.
