<!--Short descriptsions about research topics-->
<!--STE(A)M education and Citizen science-->
<div id="p1" class="research-elem">
<h2 class="mt-5">STE(A)M education and Citizen science</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Research group aims to enhance educational practices of formal and informal inquiry learning with the location-and sensor-based technologies. Goal is to investigate smart city approaches where learning services and the co-creation of learning are part of the smart city as a socio-technical environment. Smart classroom activities and learning outside the classroom supporting inquiry-based learning by using sensor technologies is seen as part of that STEM movement in the design of the learning activities. Improving STE(A)M education is considered important to enhance the learners' design thinking skills and digital competences through technology innovation projects.</p>
