<h4 id="project-overview">Project overview</h4>
<p>The project develops innovative educational approaches to practical STEAM education that are based on Computational Thinking (CT) as related to trans-disciplinary and holistic STEAM perspectives. We promote a pragmatic approach to CT as to a set of tools, techniques and approaches which enable a seamless transition from the early-aged child’s unplug activities to a comprehensive modelling and computer simulation activities of K-12 and early years university students.
Objectives: (1) to improve pedagogical skills and competencies of prospective teachers, that are related to the teaching and training of various aspects of CT; (2) improve CT skills of prospective teachers.</p>
