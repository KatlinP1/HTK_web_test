<h4 id="project-overview">Project overview</h4>
<p>LanguageGames aims at the development of multilingual skills in early childhood learning, spanning pre-primary and early primary education, in an active and experiential manner. The project takes current practices for language skill building a step further by exploiting emerging state-of-the-art serious games-enhanced learning frameworks adapted to the cognitive development level of young learners. The proposed active learning approach will immerse young learners in activities that take inspiration from real-life and familiar school practices offering benefits that include immediate feedback for scaffolding knowledge by better understanding mistakes, motivational factors in the form of game rewards, collaboration opportunities, and the development of problem-solving skills through puzzles. The proposed tools will be designed for classroom deployment, as opposed to standalone use, in the context of wider language learning activities thus enhancing existing school practices in language education. The proposed serious game for language learning will integrate age-appropriate, well accepted syllabic language learning methodologies that help youngsters build word recognition and reproduction capacity.</p>
