<h4 id="project-overview">Project overview</h4>
<p>In the framework of this project, the aim was to find out the practices of implementing the technology of general education schools in the light of education innovation and change management. To do this, we conducted a qualitative study to find answers to the following research questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the different levels of digital maturation in Estonian general education schools on the basis of the relationship between the components?</li>
  <li>Which components describe a digitally mature educational institution (infrastructure, teaching methods, leadership practices), and what is the link between the school ‘s digital maturity and the the implementation of educational innovation?</li>
  <li>What features does Digipeegel offer to assess the organization in a wider context rewording metrics?</li>
  <li>How do Digipeegel users value the user experience of the tool and which options they see for improving it?</li>
</ul>
