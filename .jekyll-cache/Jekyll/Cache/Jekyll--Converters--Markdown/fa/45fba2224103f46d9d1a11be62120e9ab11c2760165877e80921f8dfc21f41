                University of Rijeka is coordinating the project that will be implemented in Croatia through collaboration with Tallinn University, University of Ljubljana, South-West University ‚ÄúNeofit Rilski‚Äù (Bulgaria) and St. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje.
                The GLAT project was funded by the Erasmus Plus call that sought to prompt cooperation for innovation and exchange of good practices and strategic partnership among institutions.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The overall goal of the object is to allay the fears of young students about coding by equipping the student with algorithmic thinking skills. The main objective of the project however, is to promote the integration coding and algorithmic thinking into the first grades of curriculum of primary schools. To achieve the project objectives, a group of Croatian teachers are going to be trained to develop their knowledge and skills about Game-Based Learning strategies as well as didactics for teaching algorithmic thinking and coding to the students.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Consequently, the project consortium is made up of experts in the fields of Game-based learning, informatics, virtual learning, didactics and instructional design. The intellectual output the project is to produce a syllabus and materials which will be used in Croatian primary schools specifically and, after translating resources to English, across Europe generally.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The key role of Tallinn University is to introduce lesson planning application/ tool (leplanner.net) designed by the School Digital Technologies to the teachers. (The application is intended to help the teachers design, visualize and share their learning scenarios.)
                    </li>
                    <li>In addition, a team from the Centre for Educational Technology of the School of Digital Technologies ‚Äì made up of two Senior Researchers and One doctoral student (Mart Laanpere, Kai Pata and James Sunney Quaicoe respectively) will facilitate two teacher training Worksop sessions in Rijeka, Croatia. The project is expected span between October 2017 and September 2019.
