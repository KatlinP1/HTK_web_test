I")<p>For the Centre for Educational Technology, January brought along a kick-off of another exciting research and development project: IC-health. The official starting meeting of the project took place from 23-24 January in the sunshine of Tenerife, Santa Cruz de Tenerife.</p>

<p>“Improving digital health literacy in Europe — IC-Health” or just “IC-Health” for short is a two-year Horizon 2020 project which aims to increase citizens’ awareness about eHealth tools, establish communities of practice around digital health literacy and empower the citizens to take a more active role in managing their health. As one of the main outcomes of the project, 35 Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in seven European languages will be created in a co-design process involving communities of practice in a number of European countries. The MOOCs will later be made available on as large number of various MOOC platforms as possible.</p>

<p>The Coordinator of the 14-member project consortium is the General Directorate for Public Health of Canary Islands Government. The rest of the consortium is a diverse mix of universities, SMEs, public institutions and non-profits from Spain, Italy, UK, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Ireland and Estonia.</p>

<p>The role of the Centre for Educational Technology in the project is to provide expertise on digital literacy and co-design and to lead the development, testing, fine-tuning and monitoring the usage of MOOCs. In this respect we can draw on our experience from earlier European projects such as EMMA and Learning Layers.</p>

<p>While eHealth initiatives may abound in start-up world and on the state-level, we find that IC-Health is filling an important gap - empowering ordinary citizens to use right online resources in a right way to gain control in managing their health.</p>
