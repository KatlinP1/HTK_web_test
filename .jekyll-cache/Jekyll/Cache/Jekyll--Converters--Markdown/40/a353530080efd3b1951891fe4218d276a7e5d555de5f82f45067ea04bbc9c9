The project intellectual outputs will be tested in four higher education and applied higher education institutions in Estonia, Greece, Finland and Portugal.</p>

<p>Project partners are Tallinn University, Porto Polytechnic University from Portugal, Metropolia University of Applied Sciences from Finland, Center for Research and Technology Hellas and Thessaloniki University from Greece.

<p>At the project kick-off meeting in Volos, Thessaloniki University (26-27.10.2017) the team discussed how to investigate the state of art of teaching design thinking in the partner countries. In Tallinn University the largest application field of design thinking is in interdisciplinary ELU projects, as well as in all project based courses.
