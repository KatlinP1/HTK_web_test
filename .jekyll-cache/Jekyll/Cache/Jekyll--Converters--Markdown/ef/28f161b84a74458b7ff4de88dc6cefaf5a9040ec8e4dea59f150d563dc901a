<h4 id="project-overview">Project overview</h4>
<p>ILLUMINE contributes to improving the quality of learning and teaching in school education by supporting teachers (pre-service and in-service) with digital open educational resources to aid in planning and delivering learning experiences with the use of technology that are based on the science of learning. ILLUMINE is an extension of Project IlluminatED, which delivered professional development workshops on the Science of Learning for educators. The workshops were well-received, however, participating teachers noted some obstacles that prevented them from implementing what they had learned. ILLUMINE helps teachers overcome such obstacles by working directly on the implementation of practices with teachers and generating practical examples (case studies) for others to follow.</p>
