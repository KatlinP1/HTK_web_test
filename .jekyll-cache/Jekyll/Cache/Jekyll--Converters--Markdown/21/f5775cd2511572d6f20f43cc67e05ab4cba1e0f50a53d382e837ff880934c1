<h4 id="project-overview">Project overview</h4>
<p>The project aims to build common understanding about CT among the collaborators and widen our thinking about how to include future technologies (e.g., AI, autonomous transportation, cyber security) into CT through perspectives from different fields, such as educational sciences and computer science. The project involves schools and universities as participating institutions. Through this project we are enhancing professional development of teachers who are interested in applying CT and maker education into their classrooms, and building networks among participating institutions. As outcome of the project we develop a versatile assessment tool which can be used in various cases beyond different conditions (e.g., curriculum, activity, pupilsâ€™ grade level and interests). In this way we tackle the challenges of current effort to integrate CT into school curriculum.</p>
