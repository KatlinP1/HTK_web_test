<p>Â 
The development of a consolidated DigCompOrg SAT (i.e. a standardised question set) to allow schools to self-reflect as organisations; track their progress in integrating DLT&amp;R over time; compare themselves with others; identify strong points and areas for improvement; and finally, raise their digital maturity level. The DigCompOrg SAT will be user friendly and relevant not only to schools. It will enable education policy makers (at a local, regional, national and international level) to design, implement and appraise programmes, projects and policy interventions for the integration of DLT&amp;L in education systems across Europe.</p>

<p>The aim of the project Adult Education as a Means to Active Participatory Citizenship (EduMAP) is to understand and develop the real and potential impact of adult education on learning for active participatory citizenship in Europe. The main research question is: What policies and practices are needed in the field of adult education to include young adults at risk of social exclusion in active participatory citizenship in Europe? EduMAP will compile an inventory of the adult education policies and practices in EU Member States, with a particular focus on their relevance with regard to young adults at risk of social exclusion. Successful educational practices within and outside the EU will be mapped and investigated, in order to help educational agencies to design initiatives catering for the varied needs of vulnerable minority groups. To understand how the providers and users of educational initiatives are situated in the flows of information and communication, we will study and map communicative ecologies in the field of adult education and develop innovative forums for dialogue between educational agencies and young people. The research findings will be used to generate an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) to give policy-makers and other stakeholders easy access to the information required to address the needs of vulnerable minority groups. The fundamental aim is to help policy-makers, educational authorities and educators to ensure that young generations as a whole will attain the competences needed to actively participate in society and the labour market.

<p>Changes in labour market have strong impact on low skilled workers. Lack of digital skills and low social abilities can cause problems in retraining and lead to the long term unemployment. To reduce the risk of unemployment it is important to develop digital skills according to the industry needs already in the level of primary and lower secondary school. The objective of EMPLOY project is to develop serious game and implement game based learning approach to support the development of industry related digital skills among primary and secondary school students.</p>

<p>Description: LanguageGames aims at the development of multilingual skills in early childhood learning, spanning pre-primary and early primary education, in an active and experiential manner. The project takes current practices for language skill building a step further by exploiting emerging state-of-the-art serious games-enhanced learning frameworks adapted to the cognitive development level of young learners. The proposed active learning approach will immerse young learners in activities that take inspiration from real-life and familiar school practices offering benefits that include immediate feedback for scaffolding knowledge by better understanding mistakes, motivational factors in the form of game rewards, collaboration opportunities, and the development of problem-solving skills through puzzles. The proposed tools will be designed for classroom deployment, as opposed to standalone use, in the context of wider language learning activities thus enhancing existing school practices in language education. The proposed serious game for language learning will integrate age-appropriate, well accepted syllabic language learning methodologies that help youngsters build word recognition and reproduction capacity.</p>

<p>Zoos are important institutions of preserving the natural heritage of the CB region - protecting and preserving endangered species and at the same time increasing the environmental awareness. At the moment, the use of mobile technologies for learning by visitors of the zoos is very traditional, mainly providing static information. There is an active cooperation network between the zoos of the CB region, but at the moment it is limited mainly on exchanging animals and conducting joint research.  Therefore the main objective of the current project is to integrate the zoos of the CB region into joint tourist attraction through developing and implementing a cross-border service package for creative adventure learning with mobile devices. It consists of a set of online game-based learning tools and related apps for mobile devices. The SmartZoo mobile learning service provides a reason for visitors to return to zoo several times a year and visit several zoos in one year. Thus, the SmartZoo enhances both the environmental awareness and economical growth of the CB region.</p>
