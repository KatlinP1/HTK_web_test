Research activities of the Centre for Educational Technology are tightly related with five academic fields of School of Digital Technologies and centre for excellences of other schools of TLU:

### Applied Informatics

The study area of applied informatics focuses on the problems of introducing IT studies in higher education and applying IT resources in non-IT fields. IT studies encompass both IT and non-IT specialities and works on developing study programmes, as well as analysing and ensuring the quality of the study process (incl. collaborating with alumni and companies).
Related curricula: Informatics (BA), Information Technology Management (MA) and Information Society Technologies (PhD)

**Head of Study Area:** Peeter Normak, professor\\
**E-mail:** peeter.normak@tlu.ee\\
**Telephone:** +372 640 9423\\
**Location:** A445

### Digital Learning Ecosystems

Digital Learning Ecosystems focuses on planning, modelling and designing new learning systems with the help of technology. This study area is characterised by interdisciplinarity, connecting informatics (education technologies, human-computer interaction, social and semantic technology), educational sciences (teacher education, study programme development and competence-based education) with applied cognitive psychology, which in turn helps us see the big picture in such social-technical systems in constant dynamic change and development.

### Human-Computer Interaction

Human-Computer Interaction sees interaction design as the main way of enhancing life through research, design and technology. Our work focuses on developing knowledge, skills and technology to help researchers, designers and developers to reach their goals. Various ways and levels of understanding people, design processes and technology are vital to us.

### Information Sciences

Information Sciences focuses on promoting the research, development and studies in information management, information behaviour, digital competences, digital libraries, digital humanities, digital cultural heritage, electronic publishing and electronic document and archive management. The goal of this area is to enhance and develop study programmes that would help Estonian and foreign students to obtain a degree based on information sciences on all levels that would be on a high level, internationally competitive and would serve the needs of the society. According to negotiations between the Ministry of Education and Research and Estonian Universities, the Information Sciences academic field is co-responsible for developing the area of information sciences in Estonia. The mission of this academic field is to support the sustainable development on Estonia through helping information science professionals and researchers, applying research, societal thought exchange and promoting academic partnerships.
