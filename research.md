Interdiscplinary research activities of the Centre for Educational Technology are tightly related with five academic fields of School of Digital Technologies and centre for excellences of other schools of TLU:

### STE(A)M education and Citizen science

Research group aims to enhance educational practices of formal and informal inquiry learning with the location-and sensor-based technologies. Goal is to investigate smart city approaches where learning services and the co-creation of learning are part of the smart city as a socio-technical environment. Smart classroom activities and learning outside the classroom supporting inquiry-based learning by using sensor technologies is seen as part of that STEM movement in the design of the learning activities. Improving STE(A)M education is considered important to enhance the learners' design thinking skills and digital competences through technology innovation projects.

### Digital transformation of the organizations

Research group aims to investigate the digital transformation at the organizations and how it can be explained and influenced. Also group focuses on understanding individual and organisational level learning processes and cross-institutional knowledge creation opportunities.

Related ongoing projects:

**DG-turn: Enhancing Quality of Education through Digital Innovation in Georgian Schools** - Funded by Ministry of Foreign Affairs to develop training program for Georgian schools to promote their digital innovation and maturity. Team: Eka Jeladze, Mart Laanpere, Kai Pata, Vladimir Tomberg

### Digital competences

Research group aims to investigate the methodologies for assessing digital competences and develop framework and tool for evaluating domain-specific digital competences. Group is involved in different national and international research- and policy-level intiatives and specific focus of assessing digital competences is on teacher education.

Related ongoing projects:
**DigCompEdu** - funded by EC JRC program. Aim is to pilot DigCompEdu framework with Estonian teachers. TLU is also contributing to the development of methodology and supporting tool. Team: Mart Laanpere, Linda Helene Sillat, Kairit Tammets
**ABC to VLE: beyond curriculum design** - Erasmus+ project to develop, implement, evaluate and disseminate a rapid development learning design method in the form of a downloadable 'pack' to help university and college teachers design ICT rich blended courses, investigating a range of pedagogical, technological, support, quality, cross-cultural and strategic issues. Team: Linda Helene Sillat, Kairit Tammets
**IT-Teaching development at the Tallinn University** - funded by HITSA to enhance the quality of teaching informatics teachers through updating the teacher training curriculum.

### Learning analytics 

Group is tightly integrated with other research groups to investigate possibilities for implementing evidence-based decision making in the technology-enhanced learning research and practice. The focus is on LA infrastructure, development of LA tools and also LA-driven processes in classroom and organisational level.

**Educational Data Pilots for Tallinn University: Demonstrating the Practical Benefits for Multiple Stakeholders** - Funded by TLU. Team: Kairit Tammets, Adolfo Ruiz Calleja, Tobias Ley, Maria Jesus Rodriguez Triana, Luis Pablo Prieto, Terje Väljataga, Gerti Pishtari, Shashi Kant Shankar

Team: Kairit Tammets, Adolfo Ruiz Calleja, Kaire Kollom
**eDidaktikum: competence-based collaborative learning environment for teacher education** - Funded by Ministry of Education and Science to promote evidence-based decision making in teacher education by enhancing research-driven curriculum design and shaping the development of pre-service teachers' self-regulated learning skills. Team: Kairit Tammets, Kaire Kollom, Shashi Kant Shankar

### Open Educational Resources

Group aims to design the open education ecosystem of learning resources and the accompanying digital services at Estonia with accompanying service models. Research goals are related also with the understanding how open educational resources are used in the classroom and how these materials influence the teaching and learning process and learning outcomes. 

Related ongoing projects:
