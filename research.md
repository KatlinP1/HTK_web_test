Interdiscplinary research activities of the Centre for Educational Technology are tightly related with five academic fields of School of Digital Technologies and centre for excellences of other schools of TLU:

### STE(A)M education and Citizen science

Research group aims to enhance educational practices of formal and informal inquiry learning with the location-and sensor-based technologies. Goal is to investigate smart city approaches where learning services and the co-creation of learning are part of the smart city as a socio-technical environment. Smart classroom activities and learning outside the classroom supporting inquiry-based learning by using sensor technologies is seen as part of that STEM movement in the design of the learning activities. Improving STE(A)M education is considered important to enhance the learners' design thinking skills and digital competences through technology innovation projects.

### Digital transformation of the organizations

Research group aims to investigate the digital transformation at the organizations and how it can be explained and influenced. Also group focuses on understanding individual and organisational level learning processes and cross-institutional knowledge creation opportunities.

Related ongoing projects:
**Digital Mirror** - in collaboration with Ministry of Education and Science - Mart Laanpere, Romil Rõbtšenkov, Kai Pata.

### Digital competences

Research group aims to investigate the methodologies for assessing digital competences and develop framework and tool for evaluating domain-specific digital competences. Group is involved in different national and international research- and policy-level intiatives and specific focus of assessing digital competences is on teacher education.

Related ongoing projects:
**DigCompEdu** - funded by EC JRC program. Aim is to pilot DigCompEdu framework with Estonian teachers. TLU is also contributing to the development of methodology and supporting tool. Team: Mart Laanpere, Linda Helene Sillat, Kairit Tammets
**ABC to VLE: beyond curriculum design** - Erasmus+ project. 


### Gamified learning

The team works on serious game concept application, as well as gamifying learning.
