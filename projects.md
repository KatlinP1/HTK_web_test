### SmartZoos - Cross-border services for creative adventure learning in the zoos of the Central Baltic Region

Zoos are important institutions of preserving the natural heritage of the CB region - protecting and preserving endangered species and at the same time increasing the environmental awareness. At the moment, the use of mobile technologies for learning by visitors of the zoos is very traditional, mainly providing static information. There is an active cooperation network between the zoos of the CB region, but at the moment it is limited mainly on exchanging animals and conducting joint research.  Therefore the main objective of the current project is to integrate the zoos of the CB region into joint tourist attraction through developing and implementing a cross-border service package for creative adventure learning with mobile devices. It consists of a set of online game-based learning tools and related apps for mobile devices. The SmartZoo mobile learning service provides a reason for visitors to return to zoo several times a year and visit several zoos in one year. Thus, the SmartZoo enhances both the environmental awareness and economical growth of the CB region.
