#### Project overview
The overall goal of this project was to support the Estonian Government in strengthening data-informed decision-making in education through improvements to its education monitoring system. This implies a comprehensive review of the existing data and monitoring processes, and recommendations for their enhancement based on local and international expertise. In order to achieve the outcome of the Project (a coherent and comprehensive set of recommended indicators and monitoring principles aligned to Estonia’s Education Strategy 2035, based on a thorough analysis of existing indicators, practices and data needs, and reviewed by national stakeholders), the OECD composed a specific team including a high-level local and OECD experts. The team worked with Estonia for 18 months in a range of activities, including analysis, strategic advice and stakeholder engagement seminars.
