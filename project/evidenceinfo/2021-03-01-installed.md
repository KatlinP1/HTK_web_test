#### Project overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has thoroughly disrupted the organisation of daily education in the recent months. The mandated closure of schools in the past months has presented teachers of all educational levels with great challenges. The switch to online and distance learning imposed new technologies and online tools on teachers and students. Concurrently to the practical and content-wise modifications, teachers were expected to support their students from a distance. Students need more than ever before self-regulated learning skills in order to successfully adapt to new instructional approaches in which students have an increased autonomy.  The availability of SRL skills with students greatly impacts their learning. We believe the timing is right to help teachers support studentsâ€™ SRL, especially during online education. The project aims to deliver theory based user friendly solutions for online, hybrid and blended learning that teachers and students can use in their everyday school to make learning and teaching more efficient and enjoyable.
