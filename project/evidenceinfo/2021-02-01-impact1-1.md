#### Project overview
In the educational landscape, the supply of teaching materials and environments and the demand for the use of equipment one by one are growing.  The project aims to validate and implement evidence-based solutions, advise teachers and find the most mobile one-to-one devices for these practical tests. At the end of the project, guidelines will be developed to be used in the use of equipment and the choice of teaching materials.
