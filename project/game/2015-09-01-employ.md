#### Project overview
Changes in labour market have strong impact on low skilled workers. Lack of digital skills and low social abilities can cause problems in retraining and lead to the long term unemployment. To reduce the risk of unemployment it is important to develop digital skills according to the industry needs already in the level of primary and lower secondary school. The objective of EMPLOY project is to develop serious game and implement game based learning approach to support the development of industry related digital skills among primary and secondary school students.
