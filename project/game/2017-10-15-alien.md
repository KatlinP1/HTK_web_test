#### Project overview
Traditional learning methodologies based on passive transmission of information, fail to develop a set of competences that students require for their professional life and their relation with the surrounding Society. Therefore, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are required to modernize their pedagogical methodologies, moving into active learning processes whereby students engage in activities that promote higher order learning skills like analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. The objective of the ALIEN (Active Learning In ENgineering education) project is thus to design, implement and validate an active learning methodology based on PBL (Project/Problem) environments addressing real-life issues related to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) concepts. The methodology was supported by a VLE including a set of digital tools that will allow students to experiment, collaborate and communicate in an extended and multinational learning community that also includes other stakeholders like teachers and researchers.
