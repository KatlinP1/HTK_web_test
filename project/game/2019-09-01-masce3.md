#### Project overview
The idea of this project is to close the gap between "normal mathematics lessons" and Math Trails as a "special learning and teaching method" through adapting them to the European curricula of mathematics education and combining the needs of teachers with the technical possibilities of digitization. Surveys among teachers and MathCityMap users show that they wish for methods to assess students, follow their learning progress while running a trail, that they have sorrows in terms of supervision and that the amount of work for the preparation of a Math Trail is one of the main reasons why teachers do not use Math Trails regularly. To reach the project's aim, three different components are addressed: (1) digital tool, (2) connect the running of Math Trails to the curriculum teachers have to use and (3) create different forms of teacher training on how to use the system regularly. These activities support teachers to regularly use Math Trails in their teaching and encouraged them to do so.
