DT4S aims to build awareness, basic knowledge, positive attitudes, problem solving skills, collaboration ability, and ability to synthesize innovative solutions among secondary education students aged 12-16 for preparing them to actively engage in sustainable development practices individually and in their communities as civically minded young adults.
