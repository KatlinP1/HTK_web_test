#### Project overview
Integrated Design combines valuable areas such as problem solving methodologies (Design Thinking and Problem Based Learning), sustainable development, circular economy, innovation thinking and entrepreneurial skills. Integrated Design is an answer to complexity of the world and projects undertaken at universities, in companies and various institutions. Integrated Design in education is related to the modernization agenda for higher education. The goal of this change is to link education with research and business and to provide innovative teaching and learning methods in order to increase the effectiveness of higher education. Materials worked out during the High5 will be dedicated to academic teachers and students. The High5 results will fit in innovative learning techniques and will be attractive for the wide range of target groups.
