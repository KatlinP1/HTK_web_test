#### Project overview
The project aims to develop higher education (HE) student skills aligned with the needs of the world of work and society. HERA introduces active learning interventions that help build the foundations of engineering knowledge as well as critical, analytical, entrepreneurial mindsets and the capacity of young engineers to work across borders and fields.
HERA aims to achieve the above objectives by introducing an active, experiential learning approach that exposes students to the industrial business processes for the 21st century. HERA aims to design an active learning framework for HE engineering classrooms that increases the
active participation of students in learning and their engagement in problem solving activities that promote critical and entrepreneurial minds. Furthermore, the HERA framework will expose students to project-based approaches deployed in industry, thus preparing them for what they will be exposed as young professionals upon graduation.
