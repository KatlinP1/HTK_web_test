#### Project overview
The development of a consolidated DigCompOrg SAT (i.e. a standardised question set) to allow schools to self-reflect as organisations; track their progress in integrating DLT&R over time; compare themselves with others; identify strong points and areas for improvement; and finally, raise their digital maturity level. The DigCompOrg SAT will be user friendly and relevant not only to schools. It will enable education policy makers (at a local, regional, national and international level) to design, implement and appraise programmes, projects and policy interventions for the integration of DLT&L in education systems across Europe.
