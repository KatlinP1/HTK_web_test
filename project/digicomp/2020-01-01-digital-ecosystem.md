#### Project overview
The project focuses on developing educator’s professional development digital ecosystem. Digital ecosystem integrates different stand- alone technological solutions which have been designed for supporting, monitoring and evaluating the educators’ professional development but have yet to be integrated. Based on the previous the aim of the project is to develop a digital ecosystem which supports data exchange between the platforms and thus allowing to design practices for supporting teachers’ evidence-based professional development. Evidence-based practices through learning analytics will significantly contribute to instructional level practices and enhancing organisational level development improvements and planning. The project views educators’ professional development as one of the workplace learning context. Developed digital ecosystem is adaptable to any workplace learning cases.
