#### Project overview
Contributing to the delivery of a validated digital competence self-assessment tool for educational at primary, secondary, vocational and higher education. As more specific objective related to Lot 2, the aim of this contract was to organize piloting of DigCompEdu Self Assessment Tool (DigCompEduSAT) in Estonia, Finland and Denmark with a minimum of 900 pilot participants. In addition, we analysed the findings of the pilot and derive recommendations for the improvement of the DigCompEduSAT. The pilot was organized according to the specifications and requirements presented in the instruction documents provided by the JRC.
We implemented the project as a joint research effort between the institute in Estonia, Finland, and Denmark. The joint effort was coordinated by the Estonian research team.
