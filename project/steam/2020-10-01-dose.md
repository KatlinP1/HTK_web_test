#### Project overview
The objective of the Development of STEAM education project is to lead European schools in the improvement of existing STEAM approaches, to guide them fostering the young Europeans’ interest, skills, and career in maths, science, engineering, and technology as well as arts, and to provide the schools with the necessary toolbox to engage their students, teachers and other members of the community in STEAM-related activities by developing an appropriate STEAM school strategy. Providing adequate guidance and underpinning innovative activities to be developed at the national level, the Project will expand a network of STEAM schools involving not only teachers, administrators, but also other stakeholders, e.g., STEAM/research/non-formal education centres.
