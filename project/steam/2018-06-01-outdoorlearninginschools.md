#### Project overview
The aim of the project is to develop the integration of various subjects in the field of the STEAM concept in such a way that the integration of the natural sciences subjects (natural science, biology, geography, physics, chemistry) in one study scenario additionally completes the integration of at least one of the following subjects: mathematics, technology (work instruction, crafts and homework, technology education), social sciences (human learning, history, social studies), arts (music, art), physical education. The role of TLU is to organise and run workshops in order to support project partners.
