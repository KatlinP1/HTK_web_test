#### Project overview
The “Circular Economy” refers to the concept of saving natural resources and to reuse and recycle them. The project ThreeC aims at integrating the concept of the Circular Economy as attractive new learning field in European school education. ThreeC seeks to combine  attractive and relevant content (the Circular Economy) with modern, self-guided learning formats using state-of-the art IT based, holistic learning environments that also include validation of learning outcomes and competence developments.
