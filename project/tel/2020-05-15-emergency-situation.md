#### Project overview
The aim of the study is to find out the experience of Estonian general education schools in conducting distance learning and to map the challenges, good practices and development needs that different parties experienced in the process. The results of the study provide an overview of the factors that influence the distance learning experience at the school, class and student level, providing input for the planning of further study management as well as the development and use of digital solutions and learning resources.
