#### Project overview
Emma aimed to showcase excellence in innovative teaching methodologies and learning approaches through the large-scale piloting of MOOCs, providing a system for the delivery of free, open, online courses from diverse European universities with the goal of preserving Europe’s rich cultural, educational and linguistic heritage and promoting cross-cultural and multi-lingual learning. Building on existing and proven technology, EMMA provides an opportunity, even for smaller institutions, to share high-quality content. EMMA operates in two main modes; as an aggregator and hosting system of courses produced by European universities; and as a system that enables learners to construct their own courses using units from MOOCs as building blocks. The pilot will operate in 2 steps, first by making available a significant number of existing courses from project partners and/or MOOCs providers and then by bringing on board a second tier of universities keen to experiment with MOOCs. Pilots will run in 7 countries with a total of 16 MOOCs and will involve at least 60.000 users. Advances in learning analytics will feature in the analysis and evaluation work and a series of innovative approaches will be trialed to make the piloted service sustainable in the medium to long term.
