#### Project overview
The main objective of the project was encouraging the integration of coding and algorithmic thinking into the daily teaching through different subjects in students' younger ages (from first to fourth grade of primary school). The goal was achieved by further professional training of teachers including the acquisition of contemporary knowledge and skills connected to different ICT related innovative teaching methodologies such as Problem Based Learning (PBL), Inquiry Based Learning (IBL), Game Based Learning (GBL). Special attention was devoted to learning digital skills in general as well as problem-solving skills, logic and creativity, particularlly with the help of serious games and direct application of GBL and gamification.
